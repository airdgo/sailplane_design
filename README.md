# Preliminary Sizing and Design of a Standard Class Sailplane

This thesis aims at the conceptual development and preliminary sizing of a sailplane according to the aeronautical regulations regarding sailplanes in the utility category, and to ensure a high level of safety and performance. The main characteristics regarding weight, geometry, and aerodynamics of the aircraft will be established, using a series of studies and statistical methods based on glider models designed in the past. Established mathematical methods will be used to verify the aerodynamic characteristics and performance.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've got more familiar with flexbox and hover effects and animations.

Animation when cursor hovers over the cards:

```css
.sedans,
.suvs,
.luxury {
	transition: transform 0.5s;
}

.sedans,
.luxury {
	z-index: 1;
}

.suvs:hover {
	transform: scaleY(1.05);
}

.sedans:hover,
.luxury:hover {
	transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I plan on getting more familiar with CSS animations.
